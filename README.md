Hi, Included in this branch is all of the required files using the frequency support device. However its highly recommended that the IOC be used to guide a fresh project as STMCubeIDE may throw some errors 
Please ensure this software is ran on a compatable STM32F4 series microcontroller as the HAL libraries required were tested on this platform.
